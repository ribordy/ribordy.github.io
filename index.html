            <p>
              I'm a full-stack software developer with proficiency in
              front-end frameworks and API design. I'm currently working at
              <a target="_blank" href="https://thefractalway.com">Fractal</a>,
              where we work with companies of all sizes to build sustainable software
              and sustainable software practices. Prior to that, I led development of a
              platform to conduct auctions of assets represented on the blockchain, and I
              led a team at Hulu building campaign management applications
              that powered their advertising business. In my free time, I
              enjoy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.last.fm/user/kdribordy">
              quixotically attempting to listen to all of the music</a>,
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/therealmcrib">ranting at
              no one in particular</a>, and rooting for largely
              mediocre sports teams.

          <h4>Work</h4>
          <p>
            I'm currently working with data pipelines, warehousing, and reporting,
            leveraging Apache Airflow to ensure uninterrupted availability of new
            data and working with customers to surface that data in the most effective way.
          <p>
          <p>
            I've also spent time at AUX developing smart
            contracts and applications that interact with them. This
            involved balancing security, efficiency, and user experience
            to build the contracts backing our auction platform and
            working with our product team to build out the best experience
            for our end users interacting with them. To do this, we
            primarily used Rails, React, and Solidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to working at AUX, I was working closely with Hulu's
            ad sales teams to build a campaign management platform that
            allowed the most efficient use of Hulu's inventory. In that
            role, I was working with a range of languages and frameworks
            including Ruby on Rails, React, AngularJS, and Python.
